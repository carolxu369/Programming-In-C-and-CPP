Doing some basic checking for your submission

Step 1
Checking that cyoa-step1 compiles
rm -f *.o *~ cyoa-step1 *~ cyoa-step2 *~ cyoa-step3 *~ cyoa-step4
g++ -std=gnu++98 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -c cyoa-step1.cpp
g++ -std=gnu++98 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -c story.cpp
g++ -o cyoa-step1 cyoa-step1.o story.o
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step1 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 1
------------------------------------


1.1: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story1 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean


1.2: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story2 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean
------------------------------------
You have requested that we check for intermediate deadline completion on step 1
------------------------------------

Step 1 EC intermediate deadline test 1
===========================================================
./cyoa-step1 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story1
